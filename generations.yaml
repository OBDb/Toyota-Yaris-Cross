    description: "The Toyota Yaris Cross represents Toyota's entry into the increasingly popular subcompact crossover segment, based on the same TNGA-B platform as the fourth-generation Yaris hatchback but with SUV-inspired styling, increased ride height, and available all-wheel drive. Measuring approximately 4.18 meters in length, the Yaris Cross slots below the C-HR in Toyota's global crossover lineup while offering a more conventional, practical design than its style-focused sibling. The exterior features distinctive SUV elements including black wheel arch cladding, roof rails, increased ground clearance, and an upright silhouette while maintaining clear Yaris family design cues. Powertrain options vary by market but center around Toyota's 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine, available in both conventional and hybrid configurations, the latter combining the gasoline engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 116 horsepower while achieving approximately 60 mpg in the European WLTP test cycle. Most markets receive front-wheel drive as standard, with Toyota's AWD-i all-wheel drive system optional on hybrid variants—a rarity in the subcompact crossover segment. The interior carries over many elements from the Yaris hatchback, featuring a driver-focused dashboard with a standard 7-inch or optional 10.5-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster on higher trims, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. Practicality is enhanced over the standard Yaris with a slightly increased ride height for easier ingress/egress, more generous rear seat space, and up to 397 liters of cargo capacity—a 67-liter increase over the hatchback. Safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense standard across most trim levels, offering features including pre-collision system with pedestrian and cyclist detection, adaptive cruise control, lane trace assist, and automatic high beams. Available in multiple trim levels from the basic Active to the more luxurious Premiere Edition with unique color options and enhanced equipment, the Yaris Cross aims to capture a share of the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment by combining the proven efficiency and reliability of the Yaris nameplate with the higher riding position and more versatile packaging desired by many contemporary consumers."
