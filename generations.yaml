    description: "The XP210 series Yaris Cross is Toyota's subcompact crossover based on the TNGA-B platform, sharing its architecture with the fourth-generation Yaris hatchback. Originally unveiled in April 2020 after the Geneva Motor Show cancellation, it went on sale in Japan in August 2020, Australia in November 2020, and Europe in mid-2021. Positioned between the Aygo X/C-HR and above the Raize in Toyota's crossover lineup, it features SUV-inspired styling with increased ground clearance, black wheel arch cladding, and roof rails. The XP210 measures approximately 4.18 meters in length and offers optional all-wheel drive (AWD-i) on hybrid variants—a rare feature in the B-segment SUV class. Powertrains include a 1.5L three-cylinder petrol engine (M15A-FKS) producing 118 hp, and a hybrid system (M15A-FXE) combining the same engine with an electric motor for 116 hp total output. Interior features a 7-inch or optional 10.5-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, digital instrument cluster, and Toyota Safety Sense standard across most trims. The vehicle is manufactured in Japan (Toyota Motor East Japan) and France (Toyota Motor Manufacturing France). In November 2023, updates included a new Premiere Edition trim, improved power output to 130 hp, new Toyota Smart Connect multimedia system with 12.3-inch instrument panel, and enhanced safety features."

    description: "The AC200 series Yaris Cross is a larger subcompact crossover based on the Daihatsu New Global Architecture (DNGA-B), developed by Toyota's Emerging-market Compact Car Company joint venture with Daihatsu. Unveiled in Indonesia on May 15, 2023, with production starting June 13, 2023, this version is marketed primarily in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Taiwan, and other emerging markets. Unlike the XP210, the AC200 is larger and positioned as a more affordable option in these regions. It shares its platform with the AC100 series Vios/Yaris sedan and the Daihatsu Avanza/Veloz. Powertrains include a 1.5L four-cylinder petrol engine (2NR-VE) producing 106 hp, and a hybrid system (2NR-VEX) rated at 103 hp from the engine plus 82 hp from the electric motor. The hybrid uses a smaller 0.7 kWh lithium-ion battery compared to the XP210's system. Available with 5-speed manual, Dual Mode CVT (D-CVT), or eCVT depending on market and trim. Toyota Safety Sense is standard on higher trims. The vehicle is produced at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia in Karawang for export to 25 countries, and also assembled in Taiwan by Kuozui Motors. In Malaysia, it is sold as the Perodua Traz (petrol only)."
